- be resilient to environmental hazards

We provide expert services and impartial advice in all areas of
geoscience. As a public sector organisation, we are responsible for
advising the UK Government on all aspects of geoscience as well as
providing impartial geological advice to industry, academia and the
public. Our client base is drawn from the public and private sectors
both in the UK and internationally.

The BGS is a component body of the Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

**DATA PRODUCTS**

The BGS produces a wide range of data products that align to government
policy and stakeholder needs. These include baseline geological data,
engineering properties and geohazards datasets. These products are
developed using in-house scientific and digital expertise, and are based
on the outputs of our research programmes and substantial national data
holdings.

Our products are supported by stakeholder focus groups, identification
of gaps in current knowledge and policy assessments. They help to
improve understanding and communication of the impact of
geo-environmental properties and hazards in Great Britain, thereby
improving society’s resilience and enabling people, businesses, and the
government to make better-informed decisions. The radon potential data
represents a collaboration between UK Health Security Agency (formerly
Public Health England) and the British Geological Survey.

# Summary

Developed by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and UK Health Security
Agency (UKHSA, formerly Public Health England (PHE)), the radon
potential data informs about the likelihood of a property having a radon
level being at or above the Action Level for dwellings in Great Britain.
The data provides information about ground conditions relating to health
protection of the occupants (dwellings).

This product was developed as studies have shown that long-term exposure
to elevated levels of radon, the biggest source of ionising radiation
dose to the average UK citizen, increases the risk of lung cancer. The
dataset combines Indoor Radon Measurements (560740 records) and Geology
(at 1:50 000 scale). The output provides an assessment of the likelihood
of a dwelling having a radon concentration at or above the Action Level
based on its location. The data does not provide the actual radon level
within a specific dwelling.

The outputs are classified using the Affected Area levels defined by
UKHSA and Radon Protection levels (based on [BR 211 guidance (Radon:
Guidance on protective measures for new buildings BRE 211 (Scivyer
2015))](https://www.brebookshop.com/details.jsp?id=327584)) indicating
where it may be necessary to apply preventative measures in new
buildings and extensions.

quick-start guide to using and understanding this UKHSA/BGS data product
version 3.

# Introduction

The Radon Potential data classifies areas based on their likelihood of a
property having a radon level at or above the Action Level in Great
Britain (Figure 1).

Radon is a natural radioactive gas, which enters buildings from the
ground and persists or accumulates where ventilation is poor. Prolonged
exposure to elevated levels of radon increases the risk of lung cancer.
Indoor radon is the biggest source of long-term human exposure to
ionising radiation in the UK. On average, for the UK population, indoor
radon is responsible for an estimated 1100 lung cancer deaths a year
(McColl et al., 2010).

The UK is required to set a reference level for the exposure of members
of the public to indoor radon (The Ionising Radiation (Basic Safety
Standards) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2018, SI 482/2018).
The Action Level for UK homes is 200 Bq m<sup>-3</sup>. UKHSA recommends
that radon levels should be reduced in homes where the annual average
radon concentration is equal to, or greater than, the Action Level. The
Radon Potential data was developed in order to meet these UKHSA
definitions.

The dataset combines indoor radon measurements (560740 records) provided
by UKHSA and geology provided by the BGS. A simplified geology was
derived from the *bedrock* and the *superficial* units of BGS Geology
50000 version 8 (formerly known as DiGMapGB-50) at  
1:50000 scale. The Radon Potential is calculated from statistics (namely
geometric mean and geometric standard deviation) of indoor radon
measurements collected over each simplified geology unit. The output
provides an estimate of the probability of a dwelling having a radon
concentration at or above the Action Level based on its location.

The Radon Potential is shown in six discrete Radon Classes (RnC 1 to RnC
6) with increasing Radon Potential (RnP, see Table 1). The areas
classified as RnC 2 (Radon Potential equal or above 1% and less than 3%)
up to RnC 6 (Radon Potential greater than 30%) are considered by the
UKHSA as Radon Affected Areas. These Radon Classes are used to identify
areas where a further radon measurement is recommended by UKHSA, and
also for building regulation purposes to determine the level of radon
protection required in new or renovated buildings.

# Case Study: New housing development proposals in England

Local planning authorities require the implementation of radon gas
preventative measures for new buildings when granting permission for a
new housing development. These requirements are defined in the Ministry
of Housing, Communities and Local Government Building regulations
(supporting guidance for the regulations is provided in [BR 211 (Scivyer
2015)](https://www.brebookshop.com/details.jsp?id=327584)).

## Why does radon potential matter?

Radon gas is a recognised health hazard with a link identified between
long-term exposure and lung cancer. Preventing radon gas accumulation in
residential dwellings is subject to building regulation guidance ([BRE
211, Scivyer 2015](https://www.brebookshop.com/details.jsp?id=327584)).
There is therefore a need for wider and more effective use of national
environmental information such as mapping of ‘radon potential’ for
strategic planning policy (e.g. Local Development Plans) and to inform
developers.

## How do local authorities and construction companies use radon potential data?

In England, proposals for a new housing development are typically
submitted to the local planning authority for approval. In drafting the
proposal, the planning officer and the developer will have to preview
via the online service provided by UKHSA
(<https://www.ukradon.org/information/ukmaps>) and BGS
(https://www.bgs.ac.uk/datasets/radon-data-indicative-atlas-of-radon/)
(see Figure 2A). The Indicative Atlas uses a 1 km x 1 km grid to provide
a generalised overview (at an approximate scale of 1:1 000 000)
indicating the maximum radon gas potential observed in each grid square.

The developer is most likely to have used the free online service to
preview the maximum radon potential. The planning officer may have also
used the same online resource, or may have used a more detailed licensed
version available from BGS
(<https://www.bgs.ac.uk/datasets/radon-data-radon-potential-dataset/>,
see Figure 2B). From the Indicative Atlas, the planning officer and
developer can independently determine that the new development area lies
within an area of maximum Radon Class 5 (Radon Potential from 10 to 30
%), and, that the specific class at the given location of the site can
be anywhere from RnC1 to RnC5.

<img src="./content/radon/media/image4.jpeg"
style="width:6.36561in;height:4.45809in" />

<span id="_Ref64897867" class="anchor"></span>Figure 2 Proposed site
(red square)  
(A) Indicative atlas (1:100000 scale) (B) Licence Radon Potential data
(1:50000 scale)

The information contained within the licensed Radon Potential Dataset is
provided at a greater spatial resolution than the free Indicative Atlas,
revealing the variation in radon potential within a given kilometre grid
square (Figure 2B) at 1:50 000 scale.

The Planning Officer can now re-assess the proposed development site
against the higher resolution Radon Potential Dataset and see that the
site is actually within Radon Class 2 (1-3% probability of exceeding the
Action Level). This additional information enables the planning officer
to advise the developer further on managing specific aspects of
construction, or to request further actions as conditions of the
development receiving permission.

Since the proposed development site is not located in the lowest Radon
class (i.e. Class 1: radon potential from 0 to 1%), and so is identified
as a Radon Affected Area (Table 2).

Radon Guidance on protective measures for new buildings BR 211 ([Scivyer
2015](https://www.brebookshop.com/details.jsp?id=327584)) states that
developers are mandated to consult the Radon Potential Dataset (jointly
developed and approved by BGS and UKHSA) in all areas of Class 2 or
above (i.e. radon potential greater than 1%).

## How does the data provide a solution?

In the example given in Figure 2, the development site is located in a
Radon Affected Area, as defined by UKHSA. One to three percent of
dwellings in this site are estimated to have indoor radon concentrations
above the Action Level.

Although the site lies within an area identified as intermediate
probability for radon, the planning officer and developer now know that
radon protective measures are not required as this site is in England
(see Table 1 for how the action levels are classified, and which
protection measures are required for England, Wales and Scotland).
Still, according to UKHSA, testing existing buildings and fitting radon
prevention in new buildings might be considered, particularly if there
is a high-risk location such as a routinely occupied basement.

Note that the developer can accept the preview provided by the
Indicative Atlas as it provides a conservative radon class (equal to, or
higher than, the actual Radon class), and apply the corresponding
preventive measures which may be higher than necessary. Figure 2 shows
an example of such a case, with a site in Radon Class 2 (Figure 2B) but
within a kilometre square with maximum Radon Class 5 (Figure 2A). If the
developer accepts the result from the Indicative Atlas without
consulting the detailed Radon Potential Dataset, they will apply full
radon preventive measures (Table 1) for a site that the detailed Radon
Potential Dataset shows to be Radon Class 2, for which preventive
measures are not compulsory in England and Wales, and are basic in
Scotland (Table 1).

Access to the Radon Potential Dataset ensures Local Authorities and
developers are better informed. This dataset ensures that local
authorities can recognise the importance of radon and its potential
long-term impact on human health, while developers can more effectively
plan new buildings, taking into account the radon risk of the area and
adjusting the needs of their development accordingly.

The data offers two options in terms of planning: either the
identification of ‘lower’ radon potential areas for targeted housing
development, or invoking BR 211 guidance requiring radon preventative
measures to be put in place during the construction phase for areas in
Radon Class 2 and above.

## What are the outcomes and value?

The use of BGS/UKHSA information in their data analysis provides Local
Authorities with early strategic knowledge of key discernible regional
variations in land characteristics and potential land-supply, as well as
potential constraints across Local Authority areas. These include zones
classed as Radon Affected Areas. Use of the BGS/UKHSA datasets provides
Local Authorities with greater leverage and capacity to forward plan
risk and investment approaches with multiple stakeholders. Examples
include:

- The need for different spatial strategies across the Local Authority
  area to overcome different development challenges

- The likely need for different investment models to deliver housing
  infrastructure in different parts of the Local Authority area.

- Enabling the Local Authority to request early, appropriate and
  proportionate requests for site investigation from developers and
  construction teams through successive stages of the planning and
  development process.

Ultimately, the Local Authority and developers can use this data to plan
more effective and safer building of dwellings, optimising design to
suit available land.

Data used in this example are the BGS/UKHSA Radon Data in its two forms:
the open-access Indicative Atlas of Radon
<https://doi.org/10.5285/d481830d-d9b3-4a1d-9a14-9be52311db74>, and the
licenced Radon Potential Dataset
<https://doi.org/10.5285/0a2a29b5-ac3f-4909-9d48-d08c12572c35>

# Methodology

## Overview 

Previously, the potential for high radon levels in UK dwellings has been
mapped on the basis of either grouping the results of radon measurements
in dwellings by grid squares (by UKHSA), or by geological units (by
BGS).

In both cases, lognormal modelling of the distribution of radon
concentrations was applied to allow the estimated proportion of
dwellings at or above the UK Radon Action Level (200 Bq m<sup>−3</sup>)
to be mapped. Combining the grid square and geological mapping methods
gives a more accurate map than either method can provide separately
(Miles and Appleton, 2005).

A data processing workflow (Figure 3) was devised which iterates through
a series of steps. The land area is first divided up into simplified
geologies, a combination of bedrock and superficial geological
characteristics, derived from BGS Geology-50 (1:50 000 scale) digital
geological map data. A bedrock/superficial (BS) code is assigned to each
of them. Each simplified geology may appear at the land surface in many
discontinuous locations across the country.

Each simplified BS geology is then divided in 1 km squares using the [OS
British National
Grid](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-to-nationalgrid.pdf)
to produce a list of spatially referenced KMBS (a simplification of 1
km<sup>2</sup>/BS) polygons containing information about both the
simplified geology and the British National Grid 1 km square.

UKHSA has a database of over 560 740 dwellings for which long-term (3 to
6 months) measurements of radon concentration have been made, and
locations are accurately known. Each radon measurement is allocated to
its KMBS polygon followed by the measurement coordinates; the precise
location of the measurement is then removed. This procedure removes any
recognisable personal data in line with General Data Protection
Regulation guidelines.

Taking each simplified geology in turn, the spatial variation of radon
potential is mapped, treating the BS as if it were continuous over the
whole land area. Bedrock, stratigraphic (order in which rock layers are
laid down) or lithological (rock characteristics) generalisations of the
simplified geologies may be required to assure that the number of radon
measurements is sufficient to estimate the radon potential.

All maps of radon potential within different simplified geologies are
then combined to produce a map of variation in radon potential over the
whole Great Britain land surface. This dataset formed the raw data on
which processing was carried out to ensure all end-users would achieve
consistent results. All data processing was carried out using ESRI
ArcGIS 10.7 software.

## Source datasets

The following source datasets are compiled into the Radon Potential
Dataset:

- BGS Geology 50K (Bedrock and Superficial).

- UKHSA Indoor Radon Measurements.

- Ordnance Survey 1 km British National Grid.

- Ordnance Survey Coastline (Boundary line product)

# Technical Information

This section provides more information on the data product its content
and advice on best use, as well as highlighting some important
considerations.

## Scale

The Radon Potential Dataset is intended for use at 1:50 000 scale. All
spatial searches of the maps should be undertaken using a minimum 50 m
buffer. This is because the smallest detectable feature at this scale is
50 m.

## Coverage

<img src="./content/radon/media/image5.jpeg"
style="width:1.91111in;height:3.45833in" />The dataset covers Great
Britain i.e. England, Scotland and Wales (see Figure 4). Data for
Northern Ireland is available
[separately](https://metadata.bgs.ac.uk/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/1c7c53c9-dd75-1bfa-e054-002128a47908).

## Data Format

The Radon Potential Dataset has been created as vector polygons and is
available in ESRI shapefile (.shp) format and Geopackage (.gpkg). More
specialised formats may be available but may incur additional processing
costs. Please email BGS Enquiries

to request further information.

## Dataset History

In 2007, BGS in collaboration with the then Health Protection Agency
(HPA) published its first radon potential map covering England and Wales
(Miles et al 2007).

Further work was carried out with data for Scotland (2011). The first
amalgamation of these source datasets, delivering a comprehensive
dataset for Great Britain, was published in 2011 (Miles et al 2011).

Northern Ireland was released as a separate dataset in 2015 (Appleton
*et al*, 2015).

This version of the Radon Potential dataset and Indicative atlas
provides an update to our understanding of radon for Great Britain. The
new maps incorporate over 80,000 additional measurements gathered from
dwellings by UKHSA; as well as cumulative changes made to the geological
maps by BGS between June 2007 and January 2017 (see Figure 5 in the
appendix).

A modified interpolation approach (based on the original methodology)
has also been applied to allow for improved analysis of the in-dwelling
measurements.

As a result of the changes to input data and methods, there are some
areas of Great Britain that exhibit a difference in new estimated Radon
Potential class, compared with that shown by the earlier versions of the
datasets.

### Impact of new measurements

Obtaining additional measurements allows for better research of radon in
dwellings and enables better modelling of where radon is present and may
pose a risk to health. Typically, a new measurement will make a
difference to our research in one or more of the following ways: 

- A new measurement identifying radon in dwellings above 200 Bq
  m<sup>-3</sup> 

- A new measurement identifying radon in dwellings below 200 Bq
  m<sup>-3</sup> 

- A collection of results indicating a rise, or fall, in the number of
  dwellings where radon is present (or absent) 

- An association of observations with certain areas/types of geological
  materials (data clustering of samples that indicates either a
  potential receptor-source relationship with underlying geology, or an
  absence of geological source. 

The new measurement evidence may indicate that an area of dwellings is
at the same risk of exposure, an increased risk of exposure, or a
reduced risk of exposure to radon, compared with previous observations
or modelling. 

Obtaining new mapping of geology, particularly via improvement of
positional accuracy and resolution, allows for a better understanding of
the spatial distribution of rocks and soils that are acting as source
materials for radon. Typically, a new map, or a revised original map
will make a difference to our research in the following ways 

- A new, reclassified or spatially modified area of potential source
  rocks or soil. 

- A new, reclassified or spatially modified area of rock or soil that
  can act as a pathway for radon to reach ground surface 

- A new, reclassified or spatially modified area of rock or soil that
  can act as a barrier to radon reaching the ground surface 

The new mapping may indicate that source rocks and soils are still
present in area (but now possibly identified with better precision, or a
revised geometry), or that rocks and soils acting as a barrier or
preferential pathway to radon are now present. 

Used in conjunction, the UKHSA and BGS datasets help us understand where
radon is present, where it might have originated from (or is absent
from), and how it may have migrated in the subsurface.

## Displaying the data

It is recommended that data is displayed based on the CLASS field in the
attribute table. This indicates the estimated percentage of dwellings
exceeding the Radon Action Level shown in Table 3. An ESRI layer file is
provided with the dataset, SLD and QML styling is also available in the
GeoPackage. The colour palette values are shown in Table 3.

# Dataset Limitations

## Data content 

The Radon Potential Dataset has been constructed by combining BGS
Geology 50K and UKHSA indoor radon measurements. Consequently, the
values within this dataset are limited by the components on which they
are based. Given the method described within this document (see 3.1),
the values are provided here to the best of our knowledge and current
data holdings.

The Radon Potential Dataset for Great Britain is associated with radon
potential related to natural geological radon sources only. The data do
not cover the impacts of man-made features, except for ironstone mining
over the Northamptonshire Sand Formation.

The Radon Potential dataset for Great Britain is based on, and limited
to, an interpretation of the records in the possession of BGS and UKHSA
(formerly HPA, then PHE) at the time the base radon potential dataset
was created (2018).

An indication of high radon potential does not mean that an individual
property will have a high radon concentration; an indication of low
radon potential does not mean that an individual property will have a
low radon concentration. The only way to determine whether a property is
in fact above, at, or below the Action Level is to carry out a radon
measurement. Guidance on measuring radon can be obtained from UKHSA
([www.ukradon.org](https://www.ukradon.org/)).

## Scale 

The radon potential data is delivered at 1:50 000 scale, where 1 map
unit equates to 50 equivalent units on the ground.

## Accuracy/Uncertainty 

The mapping accuracy associated with the BGS Geology 50K is nominally 1
mm, which equates to 50 m on the ground at 1:50 000-map scale. This is
only a measure of how faithfully the lines are captured. Consequently,
this dataset should not be used at viewing scales finer than 1:50 000.

The indoor radon measurements are derived from individual delivery point
locations (x/y coordinates) which are processed to give a spatial
average across a 1 km grid square. The spatial variation of the
measurements is calculated and resolved using statistical methods, which
may result in uncertainty. This is inherent in any form of spatial
interpolation.

## Artefacts 

Inconsistencies in the underlying geological mapping may result in
mismatched legacy sheet boundaries resulting in unexpected changes in
Radon Potential Class.

# Frequently Asked Questions

The questions and answers below have been provided to address any
potential issues relating to how the product can be used or how it can
be interpreted. If you have any additional questions, please contact
<enquiries@bgs.ac.uk>

**Q:** How is this data supplied?

**A:** The data is provided as GIS files in a range of formats (ESRI
\*.shp, MapInfo \*.tab and GeoPackage \*.gpkg being the most common).
Users will need GIS software in order to view the vector data. There are
free-to-view services for the indicative Atlas (see
[www.ukradon.org](http://www.ukradon.org) )

**Q:** What area do these datasets cover?

**A:** These datasets are for Great Britain and cover Scotland, England
and Wales. A separate dataset is available for Northern Ireland. The
spatial coverage is based on the extent of the BGS Geology 50k bedrock
map (which incorporates an open-data coastline derived from the Ordnance
Survey), but includes a 25m buffer (as part of the data aggregation
process used to compile radon measurements). Users should be aware that
some coastal addresses may lie outside the coverage of the radon maps.

**Q:** Is there also a new dataset for Northern Ireland?

**A:** No. The dataset for Northern Ireland (published in 2015), has not
been revised for content. However, it will now be provided with updated
supporting documentation and a revised colour scheme to enable ease of
use when comparing information across the United Kingdom.

**Q:** Has the dataset changed in structure or format compared with
previous versions?

**A:** Fundamentally, no. Radon Potential Class, and Radon Potential
Class-maximum (for the Indicative atlas), are still presented as an
integer between 1 and 6 (see table 1 for class descriptions), and there
are no changes to class boundaries or definitions. The Radon Potential
dataset now identifies ‘Great Britain’ as its region of coverage,
because the revised input and modelling is integrated across the nations
of England, Wales and Scotland (previously the various datasets were
compiled individually. Attribution fields remain unchanged in terms of
type and definition.

**Q:** Has the new dataset changed in content compared with previous
versions?

**A:** The new dataset has incorporated over 80,000 additional
in-dwelling radon measurements, and a significant number of changes to
the underlying geology map, which is now based on BGS Geology 50 Version
8 (published in 2017). Please see the Data history section above for
further details

**Q:** How often will this data be updated?

**A:** The datasets are currently updated on an ad-hoc basis, reflecting
the complexity of the modelling, and the need to gather sufficient new
evidence of the presence of radon in dwellings. This version is an
update to previous datasets released in 2007 and 2011.

**Q:** Is my property in a Radon Affected Area as defined by UK Health
Security Agency (formerly Public Health England (PHE)) and, if so, what
percentage of homes are estimated to be above the Action Level?

**A:** The Radon Potential dataset can be used to identify whether a
property is in a Radon Affected Area and the percentage of homes that
are estimated to be at, or above, the radon Action Level. The Radon
class for an area is shown in the dataset, along with text describing
the nominal estimated percentage band of dwellings exceeding the Radon
Action Level (see table below). Being in a Radon Affected Area does not
mean there is a specific radon level in the property; the only way to
determine whether a dwelling is above or below the Action Level is to
carry out a radon measurement. UKHSA (formerly PHE) provides a validated
radon testing service, which can be accessed at
[www.ukradon.org](http://www.ukradon.org).

| *1*         | *No*                                        | The property is in an area where less than 1% of homes are estimated to be at or above the Action Level. The property is not in a radon Affected Area. |
| *2*         | *Yes*                                       | The property is in a radon Affected Areas where 1 to 3% of homes are estimated to be at or above the Action Level.                                     |
| *3*         | *Yes*                                       | The property is in a radon Affected Area where 3 to 5% of homes are estimated to be at or above the Action Level.                                      |
| *4*         | *Yes*                                       | The property is in a radon Affected Area where 5 to 10% of homes are estimated to be at or above the Action Level.                                     |
| *5*         | *Yes*                                       | The property is in a radon Affected Area where 10 to 30% of homes are estimated to be at or above the Action Level.                                    |
| *6*         | *Yes*                                       | The property is in a radon Affected Area where 30% or more of homes are estimated to be at or above the Action Level.                                  |

The UK is required to set a reference level for the exposure of members
of the public to indoor radon (The Ionising Radiation (Basic Safety
Standards) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2018, SI 482/2018).
The Action Level for UK homes is 200 Bq m<sup>-3</sup>. UKHSA (formerly
PHE) recommends that radon levels should be reduced in homes where the
annual average radon concentration is at, or above, the Action Level.

**Q:** If the property is in a radon-affected area what should be done.

**A:** UKHSA advises that radon gas should be measured in all properties
within Radon Affected Areas and that homes with radon levels at or above
the Action Level (200 Bq m-3) should be remediated, and where achievable
to below the Target Level of 100 Bq m-3. The probability result is only
valid for properties above ground. All basement and cellar areas are
considered to be at additional risk from high radon levels. If an
underground room such as a cellar or basement makes up part of the
living or working accommodation the property should be tested regardless
of Radon Affected Area status. Householders with levels between the
Target Level and Action Level should seriously consider reducing their
radon level, especially if they are at greater risk, such as if they are
current or ex-smokers. Whether or not a home is in fact above or below
the Action Level or Target Level can only be established by having the
building tested. UKHSA provides a radon testing service which can be
accessed at www.ukradon.org.

The information in this dataset and user guide provides an answer to one
of the standard legal enquiries on house purchase in England and Wales,
known as Law Society CON29 Enquiries of the Local Authority (2016); 3.14
Radon Gas: Do records indicate that the property is in a “Radon Affected
Area” as identified by the UK Health Security Agency. The data can also
be used to advise house buyers and sellers in Scotland.

If you are buying a currently occupied property in a Radon Affected
Area, you should ask the present owner whether radon levels have been
measured in the property. If they have, ask whether the results were at
or above the radon Action Level and if so, whether remedial measures
were installed, radon levels were re-tested, and the results of
re-testing confirmed the effectiveness of the measures.

Further information on radon is available from UKHSA at www.ukradon.org.

**Q:** Is my property in an area where radon protective measures are
required for new buildings, or extensions to existing ones, as described
in publication BR 211 (2015 edition) Radon: Guidance on protective
measures for new buildings?

**A:** When extensions are made to existing buildings in Radon Affected
Areas, or new buildings are constructed in these areas, the Building
Regulations for England, Wales and Scotland stipulate that protective
measures should be taken against radon entering the building.

Depending on the probability of buildings having radon levels associated
with one of six defined classes, the regulations may stipulate either:

1.  No protective measures

2.  Basic protective measures

3.  Full protective measures

\*\*Note that the requirement for basic measures in radon class 2
differs between England/Wales and Scotland. Users should establish which
region their dwelling resides in using appropriate boundary/jurisdiction
information such as the Ordnance Survey Boundary line dataset
(<https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/boundaryline>).
For details about measures in Northern Ireland, please refer to the
[separate dataset and user guide for Radon potential in Northern
Ireland](https://metadata.bgs.ac.uk/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/1c7c53c9-dd75-1bfa-e054-002128a47908).

More details of the protective measures required are available in BR 211
Radon: Guidance on protective measures for new buildings ([Scivyer <span
class="smallcaps">2015</span>](https://www.brebookshop.com/details.jsp?id=327584)).

Whether or not a building has a radon concentration that is above or
below the radon Action Level can only be established by having the
building tested. UKHSA provides a radon testing service, which can be
accessed at [www.ukradon.org](http://www.ukradon.org)

**Q:** What are the risks of radon?

**A:** Radon is a radioactive gas, which occurs naturally. It has no
taste, smell or colour. Special devices are needed to measure it. Radon
comes out of the ground. In an outdoor setting, it is quickly diluted to
very low levels by the atmosphere. However, in some cases for indoor
settings, radon can build up to high concentrations. In such cases, it
poses a serious risk to health. A particular concern is its link to lung
cancer.

**Q:** What is the Action Level for radon?

**A:** UKHSA recommends that radon levels should be reduced in homes
where the average is at or above 200 Becquerels per cubic metre of air
(Bq m<sup>-3</sup>). This recommendation has been endorsed by UK
Government.

The Action Level refers to the annual average concentration in a home.
To assess this, radon measurements are carried out with two detectors
(in a bedroom and living room) over three months, to average out
short-term fluctuations.

Also see ‘How can radon levels be reduced?’ for Target Level

**Q:** What is a Radon Affected Area?

**A:** UKHSA defines radon Affected Areas as those with a 1% probability
or more of a home having radon at or above the Action Level. UKHSA
recommends that people in Affected Areas should test their homes for
radon.

**Q:** How can radon levels be reduced?

**A:** Indoor radon levels can usually be substantially reduced at a
cost comparable to many home improvements. Details of methods of
reducing radon levels are available from
<https://www.ukradon.org/information/reducelevels>.

UKHSA advises that radon gas should be measured in all properties within
radon Affected Areas. UKHSA recommend that homes with radon levels at or
above the Action Level (200 Bq m<sup>-3</sup>) should be remediated,
preferably to below the Target Level of 100 Bq m<sup>-3</sup>.
Householders with levels between the Target Level and Action Level
should seriously consider reducing their radon level, especially if
inhabitants are at greater risk, such as if they are current or
ex-smokers.

**Q:** Is information available about radon in the workplace?

**A:** Information on radon measurement in the workplace and in the home
is available at

<https://www.ukradon.org/sectors/employers>

https://www.ukradon.org/sectors/householders

Additional advice on radon in the workplace can be found at
